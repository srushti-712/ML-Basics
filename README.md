# ML-Basics
ML basics repository including OOP concepts, Data Structures, Python and scikit learn   
There are 2 assignments in the first task given. 

The first assignment is based on Machine Learning and the task is to classify the pima-indian-dataset.
I have used the train_test_split from sklearn to split the dataset and then got the number of missing values (0) and replaced them with the mean of that data in that column and them created the models.  
I have used 2 algorithms to create models: 1) Logistic Regression which gave an accuracy of 78.78% 
                                           2) Naive Bayes which gave an accuracy of 77.05%

The second assignment is based on OPP concepts has 2 problems : 
1) Calculate the sum, difference and product of 2 user entered complex numbers
2) Create a Member class with name, age, phone number, address , salary and create 2 more classes namely Employee and Manager which inherit the Member class and have data members sepcialization and department respectively. The Member class has method named 'printSalary' which prints the salary of the Member.(I have overrided the printSalary method to give more specific information in the other 2 classes.)
