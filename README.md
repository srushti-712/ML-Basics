# ML-Basics
ML basics repository including OOP concepts, Data Structures, Python and scikit learn   
There are 2 assignments in the first task given. I have completed the second assignment which is based on OOP concepts.
The second assignment has 2 problems : 
1) Calculate the sum, difference and product of 2 user entered complex numbers
2) Create a Member class with name, age, phone number, address , salary and create 2 more classes namely Employee and Manager which inherit the Member class and have data members sepcialization and department respectively. The Member class has method named 'printSalary' which prints the salary of the Member.(I have overrided the printSalary method to give more specific information in the other 2 classes.)
